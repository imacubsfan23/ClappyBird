# ClappyBird
Took a previously made flappybird clone on Unity3D 
and revamped it to be controlled by clapping or 
saying 1-syllable words (i.e. "Jump" or "Up").

Check it out here (missing link): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoESkSNBo8A

Included in the game are two sliders, 
one for bottom threshold (left) and 
one for top threshold (right).
 
I do not take credit for this idea, as I got the idea from "The Coding Train" YouTube Channel. The name of this repo is also from the mentioned YouTube Channel
